        method for merging two or more yaml strings

    this method walks the parse tree of yaml data to merge the fields
    (and comments) found in subsequent sources into the data structure of the
    initial sources. any number of sources can be added to the source args, but
    only new fields and new comments from subsequent sources will be added. to
    overwrite the values in the initial source, it suffices to simply reverse 
    the order of the sources

    PLEASE NOTE:    since there is no way to uniquely identify list items between
                    two yaml documents, items are not added to existing lists.

    PLEASE NOTE:    however, lists are transversed in order to evaluate comments
                    and keys of nested dictionaries using the first item of any
                    subsequent list as a model for the scope

    PLEASE NOTE:    the way that ruamel.yaml keeps track of multi-line comments
                    can create odd results for comments which appear at the start
                    or the end of lists and dictionaries when new fields and comments 
                    are added. it is best to restrict comments to the start of lists
                    and dictionaries.
