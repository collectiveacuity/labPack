        core method for merging two or more yaml files

        this method runs recursively down the nested trees of yaml datatypes
        to merge values between two or more yaml files while maximally preserving
        order and comments from the original files

        there are three different rules:
        update - [default] adds only new fields to earlier sources
        extend - adds new fields to earlier sources and appends items
        overwrite - adds new fields and items and overwrites any earlier values 

        when merging more than two files, the order of the input files matters
        as each subsequent input will treat the previous merger as its earlier input

        PLEASE NOTE:    update only adds new fields to dictionaries, existing list
                        length is preserved, but dictionaries within a list are
                        updated with any new fields which occur in the first item of
                        a subsequent file

        PLEASE NOTE:    this method makes no checks to ensure the file path of the 
                        sources exist nor the folder path to any target output
    
    :param sources: variable-length argument list of strings with path to yaml files
    :param target: [optional] string with path to save the combined yaml data to file
    :param rule: [optional] string to determine rule for merging: update, overwrite
    :param prune: boolean to remove fields in earlier files not found in subsequent files
    :return: CommentedMap or CommentedSeq with combined values
