        method for merging two or more yaml strings

    this method walks the parse tree of yaml data to merge the values 
    (and comments) of two or more yaml data

    there are two different rules for handling conflicts between previous
    and subsequent data:
      extend        [default] a field (or comment) is added only if it doesn't exist
      overwrite     where a value (or comment) already exists, it is replaced

    PLEASE NOTE:    since there is no way to uniquely identify list items between
                    two yaml documents, items are not added to existing lists.
                    the overwrite rule also has no effect on items in lists

    PLEASE NOTE:    however, lists are transversed in order to evaluate comments
                    and keys of nested dictionaries using the first item of any
                    subsequent list as a model for the scope (for extending or
                    pruning)

    PLEASE NOTE:    the way that ruamel.yaml keeps track of multi-line comments
                    can create odd results for comments which appear at the start
                    or the end of lists and dictionaries when new fields and comments 
                    are added. it is best to restrict comments to the start of lists
                    and dictionaries.
