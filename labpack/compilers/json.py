    '''
        method for merging two or more json files

    this method walks the parse tree of json data to extend the fields
    found in subsequent sources into the data structure of the initial source. 
    any number of sources can be added to the source args, but only new fields
    from subsequent sources will be added. to overwrite values instead, it 
    suffices to simply reverse the order of the sources

    PLEASE NOTE:    since there is no way to uniquely identify list items between
                    two json documents, items are not added to existing lists.

    PLEASE NOTE:    however, lists are transversed in order to evaluate keys of 
                    nested dictionaries using the first item of any subsequent list
                    as a model for the scope

    :param sources: variable-length argument list of strings with json text
    :param output: [optional] string with path to save the combined json data to file
    :return: OrderedDict or list with merged data
